PASTRY `v1.0`
===================

Introduction
------------
`PASTRY`  is a software package for avoiding **P**ower **AS**ymme**TRY** in meta-analysis.
To uncover the associated variants with small effects in Genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we need a large sample size to obtain statistical power. If multiple studies participating in a meta-analysis utilize the same public dataset as controls, the summary statistics from these studies become correlated and lead to increased false positives. Fortunately, [Lin and Sullivan (LS) method](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20004761) proposed the correlation estimator based on the shared and unshared sample sizes, along with an optimal test statistic to account for the correlations. However, we identified that can lead to unbalanced power for detecting protective alleles (OR<1) and risk alleles (OR>1) and this power asymmetry problem occurred because the standard correlation estimator did not exactly predict the true correlation. We developed a method, called `PASTRY`, estimating the accurate correlation to overcome the power asymmetry problem.

Below we briefly describe short instructions for using the software.

Instructions
-------------
### Downloading the package
`PASTRY` supports Fortran, Python and R.
In order to download `PASTRY`, you can clone this repository via the commands.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/hanlab-SNU/PASTRY.git
$ cd PASTRY
```

### Executing the codes

#### Using Fortran,
```
# You can give the path for n studies input (if it is not the same folder) and 
$ chmod +x run_pastry.sh
$ ./run_pastry.sh -n N 
  ( + optional arguments : -i "input path" / -o "output path and prefix" / -m "maf prefix" )
```

#### Using R,

```
$ cd R
## Simulation
$ Rscript PASTRY_sim.R # (Default mode simulation will operated. If you want to change parameter, check '-h' option. ex. $ Rscript PASTRY_sim.R -h)

## Analysis (with sample data)
$ Rscript PASTRY.R -i ../sample_data/test -m ../sample_data/ -o ../sample_data/result -n 3 -s 100 -e 100 -l 100
```

#### Using Python,

```
$ cd Python
## Simulation
$ python PASTRY_sim.py # (Default mode simulation will operated. If you want to change parameter, check '-h' option. ex. $ python PASTRY_sim.py -h)

## Analysis (with sample data)
$ python PASTRY.py -i ../sample_data/test -m ../sample_data/ -o ../sample_data/result -n 3 -s 100 -e 100 -l 100
```


### Input data format
You need control, case frequency files(`casemaf.out`/`contmaf.out`) and easily processed n study files(`studyN.out`) for `PASTRY` input.

#### Making `.out` files
From the result from plink association studies(`.assos.logistic`), you can extract beta and standard error (7, 8 columns) from it.
```
# If you have n studies, make 'study1.out, study2.out,...,studyn.out'
$  awk '{print $7,$8}' study1name.assoc.logistic > study1.out
$  awk '{print $7,$8}' study2name.assoc.logistic > study2.out
....
$  awk '{print $7,$8}' studyNname.assoc.logistic > studyN.out
```

#### Making `.frq.cc` files
```
# You need plink frequency files for making maf files.
$ awk '{print $5}' studyname.frq.cc > casemaf.out
$ awk '{print $6}' studyname.frq.cc > contmaf.out
```

### Output
You can get the z statistics for the LS and PASTRY method (`Zstat_LS_xxx.out` and `Zstat_PASTRY_xxx.out`).
